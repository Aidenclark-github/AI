#### How to make concepts maps for each chapter?
The homework here is to make a concept map for each chapter after watching the lectures in the 'lectures' page. Whenever possible, your concept map should be divided into the 'topics of the chapter' (see the lectures page). In order to receive full points, each concept map should contain all of the key concepts/ideas discussed in the lectures.
